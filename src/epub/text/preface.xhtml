			<p><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">The</span> time of this story is a year and a term later than that of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">The Gold Bat.</i> The history of Wrykyn in between these two books is dealt with in a number of short stories, some of them brainy in the extreme, which have appeared in various magazines.
